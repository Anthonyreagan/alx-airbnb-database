# Database Index Performance Analysis with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

## Performance Measurement Methodology

To properly measure the impact of indexes, we:

1. Ran `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on key queries before creating indexes
2. Created the recommended indexes
3. Ran the same queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` after index creation
4. Compared the execution plans and timing

## Sample Measurement Process

### Before Index Creation
```sql
-- First, get the baseline performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM Booking 
WHERE user_id = 'user123' 
ORDER BY start_date DESC;

-- Typical output before indexes:
QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
Seq Scan on booking  (cost=0.00..1845.32 rows=32 width=72) (actual time=3.245..25.841 rows=15 loops=1)
  Filter: (user_id = 'user123'::text)
  Rows Removed by Filter: 12485
Planning Time: 0.752 ms
Execution Time: 25.912 ms
